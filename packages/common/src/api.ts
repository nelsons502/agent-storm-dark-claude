 * Single source of truth for the user-editable config. Defined as a JSON Schema so:
 *
 * 1. The runtime shape (`configShape`) and the TypeScript `Config` type are derived from it via
 *    `schema-vir` instead of being hand-written separately and drifting.
 * 2. The settings modal can import this same schema directly into `ViraJsonForm` — no parallel
 *    definition in the frontend.
 *
 * Schema-vir's `mapSchemaToShape` interprets union-type orderings (`['string', 'null']` vs
 * `['null', 'string']`) for default selection — the first arm's default wins. We keep `null` last
 * for fields whose default value is the non-null variant (matching the prior
 * `nullableShape(defaultValue)` behavior), and put `null` first only for `githubPollingAutoDisable`
 * where the absence of an auto-disable is the natural default.
