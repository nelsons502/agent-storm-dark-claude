# Branch features

At-a-glance list of features on this branch. Append one 10–15 word bullet per change.

- SPA router with `/add-repo`, `/add-worktree`, `/book` routes for empty/setup workspaces.
- Native folder-picker endpoint backs the "add repo" flow from the frontend.
- Worktrees persisted in `~/.config/agent-storm.json` instead of filesystem scan each refresh.
- Sidebar groups worktrees into Working vs Needs-attention with status dots and footer.
- Sidebar redesigned with brand mark, resizable width, and always-visible row actions.
- Worktree create/delete updates the sidebar immediately via reconcile on config save.
- Adding a worktree-child folder recognizes it as its parent repo automatically.
- "Delete repository" action available in the settings modal danger zone.
- Settings JSON form replaced with sectioned hand-written controls.
- Design tokens + SaaS-style restyle applied across the app.
- Dark-mode palette wired into the xterm terminal; renderer stays on DOM for stable copy/paste.
- Terminal supports Ctrl+Shift+C/V and clickable web links via xterm addons.
- Progress tracker driven by per-step `mergeStepsConfig` with all step state stored on the worktree config.
- Self-review step now exposes Toggle + Open-in-IDE via a hover popover instead of one overloaded click.
- Reviewer-approved step reads `gh pr view --json reviewDecision` so approvals auto-check on the PR.
- Smarter pane busy detection and clean pty restart on failure.
- WebSocket auto-reconnects and drops stale cache entries; live target fields overlay.
- Theme selection moved client-side; Geist fonts self-hosted.
- Element-book component browser at `/book` with sub-path inputs.
- "See element book" link added to settings modal.
- Electron dev mode with auto-injected auth secret and Linux desktop identity/icon.
- Electron ESM main uses `.then()` to avoid top-level `whenReady` deadlock.
- Electron bumped to ^42.1.0 to patch high-severity advisories.
- Fixed-port frontend launch config plus `npm start` tees output to `.logs/dev.log`.
- Daemon launch hardened under tsx 4.22; node-pty auto-rebuild on start.
- Rate-limit handling added to backend requests.
- Session-resume path encoding maps dots to dashes so worktrees like `app.flax.ai` resume cleanly.
- Self-review (code) popover gains "Stage trivial hunks" entry; staging now skips any import-only hunk.
- "Get approval" stops flagging red for outdated review threads — only live unresolved comments count.
- Merge steps support `dependsOn`; gated steps stay visible but render as plain unchecked until their deps land.
